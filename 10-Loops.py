# Loops
# ##################################################################################################################################
#
# In Python 3, "loops" are programming constructs that allow you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times,
# making your code more efficient and less repetitive.
# They are like a recipe that you follow repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
#
# There are two primary types of loops in Python:
#
# for loop: A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a block of code.
# It iterates over a sequence (like a list or range) and performs the specified actions for each item in the sequence.
#
# for item in sequence:
#     Code to execute for each item in the sequence
#
# while loop: A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
# It keeps looping until the condition becomes false.
#
# while condition:
#     Code to execute while the condition is true
#
# Loops are incredibly useful for tasks such as processing data, performing repetitive calculations,
# or iterating through collections of items.
# They help you automate tasks and make your code more flexible and powerful.

# Conditionals
# ########################################################################################################################
# 
# In Python 3, "conditionals" refer to programming constructs that allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions.
# They help your program execute different sets of instructions depending on whether a specified condition is true or false.
# 
# The primary conditional statements in Python are:
#
# If:  It is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
# if condition:
#     Code to execute if condition is true
#
# else: It is used with if to execute a different block of code when the condition is false.
#
# if condition:
#      Code to execute if condition is true
# else:
#      Code to execute if condition is false
#
# elif (else if): It is used to check multiple conditions sequentially and execute the first block of code where the condition is true.
#
# if condition1:
#      Code to execute if condition1 is true
# elif condition2:
#     Code to execute if condition2 is true
# else:
#     Code to execute if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
#
# Conditionals are fundamental for controlling the flow of your Python programs and making them responsive to different situations.
# They allow you to create dynamic and intelligent applications by directing the program's execution path based on the data and 
# conditions encountered during runtime.
